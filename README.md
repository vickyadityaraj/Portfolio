I recently participated in a 5-day Tailwind CSS Bootcamp offered by DevTown, and as part of the final assignment, I built my personal portfolio using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me understand how to structure a responsive website from scratch and use utility-first CSS to design modern, clean interfaces. I learned how to implement dark mode, animations like typing effects, and organize my code into modular sections for better maintainability. Overall, this hands-on experience boosted my confidence in frontend development and gave me a practical understanding of Tailwind CSS. I'm excited to keep improving and adding more features to my portfolio!
